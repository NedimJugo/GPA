## 📖 About

**GPA Calculator** is a client-side web application that helps students compute their grade point averages across different educational systems. The application supports two grading scales: college/university (6-10) and elementary/high school (1-5).

Built with vanilla JavaScript and modern CSS, the calculator features an intuitive interface with neumorphic design elements and dynamic form controls. Users can add or remove grade fields on-the-fly, visualize performance through an animated progress bar, and receive instant validation feedback.

The application requires no backend infrastructure or data storage, making it fast, accessible, and privacy-focused. Whether you're tracking semester grades, calculating cumulative GPAs, or planning your academic goals, this tool provides a simple, efficient solution.
